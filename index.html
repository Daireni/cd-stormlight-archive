                    &lsquo; The Stormlight Archive is an epic fantasy series set during a tumultuous time in the planet of Roshar&rsquo;s history, 
                    as told from the perspective of multiple characters. A war of vengeance rages on the Shattered Plains, 
                    where Kaladin the slave&rsquo;s caravan is currently headed. 
                    Already at the Plains is Dalinar Kholin, a highlord who made his name as a vicious general and warrior, 
                    but now questions the wisdom of a protracted conflict. 
                    Shallan is a young woman from a noble house, who seeks a wardship under the notorious heretic and scholar Jasnah Kholin, 
                    in the hope that it will save her family. 
                    The magic of the ancient Knights Radiant is a thing of the past, and besides, people denounce them for their betrayal of mankind. 
                    Yet there are rumors that the ancient Oaths may be spoken once again…&rsquo;

            <p class="about-author"> 
                Brandon Sanderson, born in December 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska, developed a love for reading in eighth grade 
            when his teacher introduced him to fantasy literature. Authors like Robert Jordan and Anne McCaffrey 
            inspired him to write his own stories, although his early attempts were unsuccessful.

            In 1994, Sanderson enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU) as a biochemistry major.
            From 1995 to 1997, he took a break to serve as a missionary in Seoul, Korea, 
            where he realized his passion for writing over chemistry. Upon returning to BYU, 
            he switched to an English major.

            Sanderson wrote extensively during his undergraduate years, often working night shifts at a hotel to support himself 
            and write. 
            He completed seven novels during this time but faced numerous rejections from publishers. 
            Despite this, he remained dedicated to writing.

            Volunteering for BYU’s science fiction/fantasy magazine, The Leading Edge, was a formative experience for Sanderson. 
            He also took a class from author David Farland, who advised him to attend conventions to 
            network with industry professionals. These conventions helped Sanderson meet his future agent and editors.

            In 2003, while in graduate school at BYU, Sanderson received a call from Tor editor Moshe Feder, 
            who wanted to publish his book Elantris. This marked the beginning of his professional writing career. 
            Elantris was published in May 2005, followed by the Mistborn trilogy, The Alloy of Law, Warbreaker, 
            and The Way of Kings, the first book in The Stormlight Archive series.

            After graduating with a Master’s degree in creative writing, Sanderson began teaching the same class
            he had taken from David Farland. He also co-hosts the writing advice podcast Writing Excuses.

            In July 2006, Sanderson married Emily Bushman, who later became his business manager. His writing expanded 
            into the children’s market with the Alcatraz series, and he also wrote a novella for the Infinity Blade video game series.

            In December 2007, Sanderson was chosen to complete Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series after Jordan’s passing. 
            He published The Gathering Storm in 2009, Towers of Midnight in 2010, and A Memory of Light in 2013.

            Sanderson has won numerous awards, including the David Gemmell Legend Award and the Hugo Award for his novella 
            The Emperor’s Soul. His books have been published in thirty-five languages, and he has hit the New York Times 
            Best-Seller List fifteen times. His works have also been optioned for film and television adaptations.
